http is not https

Illegal request, responding with status '400 Bad Request': 
Unsupported HTTP method: HTTP method too long (started with 'ﾪﾦ￭E￈kG'). Increase `akka.http.server.parsing.max-method-length` to support HTTP methods with more characters.

I met this error on play framework. So I asked the people on the net about this and they replied me with: http!=https.

You click to check out at an online merchant. Suddenly your browser address bar says HTTPS instead of HTTP. What's going on? Is your credit card information safe?

Good news. Your information is safe. The website you are working with has made sure that no one can steal your information.

Instead of HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), this website uses HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).

Using HTTPS, the computers agree on a "code" between them, and then they scramble the messages using that "code" so that no one in between can read them. This keeps your information safe from hackers.

They use the "code" on a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), sometimes called Transport Layer Security (TLS) to send the information back and forth.

How does HTTP work? How is HTTPS different from HTTP? This tutorial will teach you about SSL, HTTP and HTTPS.

However, a web application may just support http rather than https in somehow. And this time it is the case that https can not be used.
